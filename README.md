API Guide
==============
PayFabric Receivables APIs are organized around Representational State Transfer (**REST**) architecture and are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Below are the two API endpoints:

Website API: ``https://<PayFabric Receivables Site URL>/receivablesapi/{PortalName}/api``  
Sync API: ``https://<PayFabric Receivables Site URL>/sync/{PortalName}/api``

Where do I start?
-----------------

Want to get started with PayFabric Receivables API integration? Here's a quick check list:

1. Sign-up and configure your own PayFabric Receivables site to be used with the APIs.
2. Read up on which [API endpoint](#API-endpoints) to use. 
3. Read up on how to [authenticate](#authentication) with the APIs. 
4. Read up on how to [handle errors](#handling-exceptions) with the APIs.
5. Browse the [API docs](#api-documentation) for the API you need to work with, you could also view our [language specific examples](Samples).
6. Have a question or need help? Contact <support@nodus.com>.


API Endpoints
-------------
The two API endpoints are used in various different and similar ways. The sync api will be used for sync'ing data to the PayFabric Receivables website, while the website api will be used for all other calls; these calls include getting invoices, processing payments, and viewing data.


Authentication
--------------
All PayFabric Receivables API calls need a header containing the authorization token. Both api endpoints use similar methods of getting the authorization token, however, they can be used slightly differently.

Website API: We have a [detailed guide](Sections/APIs/API/Token.md) for authenticating with the PayFabric Receivables API.  
Sync API: We have a [detailed guide](Sections/APIs/Sync/Token.md) for authenticating with the PayFabric Receivables Sync API.


Handling Exceptions
-------------------
PayFabric Receivables uses HTTP response codes to indicate the status of requests. 

We have a [guide](Sections/Errors.md) detailing the meanings of the most common response codes that you will encounter. 


API Documentation
-----------------
PayFabric Receivables sends and receives payloads as structured [JSON Objects](Sections/Objects). 
Many of these objects are used in both requests and responses. Some of the objects (like Address) are embedded
as child elements of other objects.
